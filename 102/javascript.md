## Assignment operators :

Name | Shorthand operator	| Meaning
------|------|------
Assignment |	x = y|	x = y
Addition assignment|	x += y|	x = x + y
Subtraction assignment|	x -= y|	x = x - y
Multiplication assignment|	x *= y|	x = x * y
Division assignment	|x /= y	|x = x / y
Remainder assignment|	x %= y	|x = x % y
Exponentiation assignment|	x **= y	|x = x ** y
Left shift assignment	|x <<= y|	x = x << y
Right shift assignment|	x >>= y|	x = x >> y
Unsigned right shift assignment	|x >>>= y|	x = x >>> y
Bitwise AND assignment|	x &= y|	x = x & y
Bitwise XOR assignment|	x ^= y|	x = x ^ y
Bitwise OR assignment	| (x \= y) |	x = x  y
Logical AND assignment	|x &&= y|x && (x = y)


# Functions:

-
** Functions **are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.


Function declarations A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

##  The name of the function.


A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {…}.
For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:

function square*(number) *{

return number * number;

}

Calling functions (Links to an external site.)
Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.
