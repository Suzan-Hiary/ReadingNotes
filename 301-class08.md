## Things I want to know more about :


** 1- What does REST stand for? **

(REST) as an architectural approach to designing web services. REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP. However, most common REST API implementations use HTTP as the application protocol, and this guide focuses on designing REST APIs for HTTP. 


** 2- REST APIs are designed around a ____. ** 

 resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client. 

 ** 3- What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example. **

 which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be

     HTTP

    
       https://adventure-works.com/orders/1
  

  ** 4-What are the most common HTTP verbs? **

   The most common operations are
   * GET, 
   * POST,
   * PUT,
   * PATCH,
   *  DELETE.



   ** 5- What should the URIs be based on? ** 

   URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

   ** 6- Give an example of a good URI. **

         https://adventure-works.com/orders

  ** 7-What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing? ** 

   a bad thing ,

   all web requests impose a load on the web server. The more requests, the bigger the load.  try to avoid "chatty" web APIs that expose a large number of small resources. Such an API may require a client application to send multiple requests to find all of the data that it requires.

   ** 8- What status code does a successful GET request return? ** 

  ** GET ** retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.

  ** 9- What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?** 

  return 404 (Not Found). 

  ** 10 - What status code does a successful POST request return? ** 

  ** POST ** creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources 

  ** 11 -What status code does a successful DELETE request return? ** 

  ** DELETE**  removes the resource at the specified URI.
