# Python names and values 


## Variable Names :
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name

## Rules for Python variables: 

* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three  different variables)

### Multi Words Variable Names

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

### Camel Case : 
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "John"

### Pascal Case :
Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John"

### Snake Case :
Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John"

## Assign Multiple Values :

Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

                 Example

                    x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
                   print(x)
                   print(y)
                  print(z)

### One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
