# Read: Stacks & Queues

## What is the Stack ?

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### terminology for a stack

* ** Push ** - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
* ** Pop ** - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* ** Top **- This is the top of the stack.
* ** Peek ** - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* ** IsEmpty ** - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.


## Stacks  concepts:

### *** FILO ***

** First In Last Out **

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.


### *** LIFO ***

** Last In First Out **

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Why it is always be O(1) operation when you push to the stack ?

This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.



### What is the pseudocode of  push a value onto a stack ?





          ALOGORITHM push(value)

          // INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally

          // OUTPUT <-- none

            node = new Node(value)

            node.next <-- Top
            
          
            top <-- Node




### What is the pseudocode of  pop a value from a stack ?



                ALGORITHM pop()

                // INPUT <-- No input

                // OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack

                // EXCEPTION if stack is empty


                  Node temp <-- top

                  top <-- top.next

                  temp.next <-- null
                  
                  return temp.value







### What is the pseudocode for a peek ?



        ALGORITHM peek()

        // INPUT <-- none

        // OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack

        // EXCEPTION if stack is empty



          return top.value




### what is the pseudocode for isEmpty

          ALGORITHM isEmpty()
          
        // INPUT <-- none

        // OUTPUT <-- boolean

        return top = NULL




 # What is a Queue ?

 A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed

* Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

* Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

* Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

* Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

* IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

### Enqueue O(1)
When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

### Dequeue O(1) :

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a dequeue. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.


### Peek O(1)
When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you want to check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.
