### **Who is the Site For??** 
Every website should be designed for the 
target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the 
site owner. It is therefore very important to 
understand who your target audience is.


### ** Why People Visit YOUR Website? **
Now that you know who your visitors are, you 
need to consider why they are coming. While 
some people will simply chance across your 
website, most will visit for a specific reason. 

### ** What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?**
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every 
reason why someone visits your site but you 
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This 
information can help guide your site designs.


 ### ** What Information Your Visitors Need ? ** 
 You know who is coming to your site and why 
they are coming, so now you need to work out 
what information they need in order to achieve 
their goals quickly and effectively
