## *** Creating webpages *** : 

# Introduction:

When you are looking at a 
website, it is most likely that 
your browser will be receiving 
*HTMl* and * CSS * from the web 
server that hosts the site. The 
web browser interprets the 
 *HTML* and   *CSS *  code to create 
the page that you see.


Small websites are often written 
just using HTML and CSS. 

### How the Web Works :
When you visit a website, the web server 
hosting that site could be anywhere in the 
world. In order for you to find the location of 
the web server, your browser will first connect 
to a ** Domain Name System**  *(DNS)* server.
