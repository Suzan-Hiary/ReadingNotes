# HTML structure :


In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping 
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey 
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how 
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to 
structure documents, 
To 
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want 
to appear on the page.

## The HTML code : 



 is made up of characters that live inside angled 
brackets â€” these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually 
made up of two tags: an **opening** tag and a **closing **tag. 

The opening tags using (left and right)-angle bracket also the closing tags using them plus the forward slash.

*  ** EX: <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>**

### ** HTML Attributes ** : 

Attributes provide additional information 
about the contents of an element. They appear 
on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of two parts: a name and a value, 
separated by an equals sign.



1|Attribute	|Belongs to	|Description|

quotes.

## Body & Head  :

about the page. Anything written between the 
**<title>** tags will appear in the 
title bar (or tabs) at the top of 
the browser window, highlighted
