###  1- Components  
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Class components.

### 2- React: Component Lifecycle Events 

componentDidMount :

This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

### 3-  Controlled Component 

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a ** “controlled component”.** 

### 4-  node.js 

Node.js is an open source server environment is free runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.) 

 ### 5- npm

 npm is committed to making JavaScript development elegant, productive, and safe  

 ### 6- functional programming? 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia   

### 7- OAuth  

open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.
