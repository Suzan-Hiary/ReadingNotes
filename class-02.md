## HTML Text Formatting :
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

elements | describe|Example |
----------|---------|
 <b> |- Bold text <strong> - Important text|<b>This text is bold</b>|
<i> |- Italic text|<i>This text is italic</i>|
<em> |- Emphasized text|<em>This text is emphasized</em>|
<mark>| - Marked text|<p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>|
<del> |- Deleted text|<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>|
<ins> |- Inserted text|<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>|
<sub> |- Subscript text|<p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>|
<sup> |- Superscript text|<p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>|

## HTML Quotation and Citation Elements :
The HTML **<blockquote> **element defines a section that is quoted from another source.

Browsers usually indent** <blockquote>** elements.

* ** EX: ** 

 <p> Here is a quote from WWF's website: </p>
 <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">  
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
close to 5 million globally.
 </blockquote> 
## HTML <address> for Contact Information
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.

The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.

The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

** EX:** 
    <address>
     Written by John Doe.
     <br>Visit us at:<br>
     Example.com<br>
     Box 564, Disneyland<br>
     USA
       </address>
