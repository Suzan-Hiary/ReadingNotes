## Things I want to know more about 

## JavaScript Array map() :

#### The map()
* method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.

*  method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order.


### What does .map() return?

map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.) ... fun : It is a function to which map passes each element of given iterable.


### Keys
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity


The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys

## The spread operator :

 is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments. 

 ### What is the spread operator?
InJavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

## The spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JavaScript, including the following:
* Copying an array
* Concatenating or combining arrays
* Using Math functions
* Using an array as arguments
* Adding an item to a list
* Adding to state in React
* Combining objects
* Converting NodeList to an array

## Example of using the spread operatore 

demonstrate copying an array, splitting a string into characters, and combining the properties of two JavaScript objects.


## Example 
** How the spread operatore  can quickly combine two arrays**


    const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
        const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
         const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
         console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
