# Basic JavaScript Instructions:

## JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.


## JavaScript Statements
JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

-

**Example**


    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";






## ** Semicolons ;** 
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

        var a, b, c;     // Declare 3 variables
       a = 5;           // Assign the value 5 to a
       b = 6;           // Assign the value 6 to b
       c = a + b;       // Assign the sum of a and b to c




## JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

**Example**

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
      "Hello Dolly!";
