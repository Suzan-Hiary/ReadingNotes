## Things I want to know more about 


## *** Component Based Architecture *** :



### **What is a component? **

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Class components.

### ** What are the charactistics of a component? **

**Reusability −** Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

**Replaceable **− Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

**Not context specific **− Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

**Extensible **− A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

**Encapsulated **− A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

**Independent** − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.


### ** What are the advantages of using component based architecture? **
* Ease of deployment 
* Reduced cost 
* Ease of development 
* Reusable
* Modification of technical complexity
* Reliability
* System maintenance and evolution 
* Independent


## Props :

** “Props” ** is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.




#### *** Using Props in React ***


1- define an attribute and its value(data)

2-  pass it to child component(s) by using Props

3- render the Props Data
