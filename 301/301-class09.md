## Things I want to know more about 

### What is functional programming? 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia 


### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? 
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

### What are the benefits of a pure function? 

Pure functions benefits
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything 
This pure function will always have the same output, given the same input.

### What is immutability? 
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

### What is Referential transparency?

if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

## What is a module? 
Breaking down the code base into smaller peices and make it reusable across our software .

## What does the word ‘require’ do? 
 the bakage 

 ## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in? 

 we must require it from it file and the things which export will be available in this module


 ## What do we have to do to make a module available? 
 we must write module.export = to whatever we want to made available outside
