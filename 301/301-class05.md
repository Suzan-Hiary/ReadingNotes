# Things I want to know more about :

### Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy :

draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. 

### single responsibility principle:
 techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

 #### What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? 
 this means that all the rendering of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is done on the client side, rather then relying on server side technologies.

 #### Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
 Props & State

 ### What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state? 
 1- does it get passed to the component or managed within the component ? if managed with the component that mean its state .

 2- Can change inside Component?

 3- Can set initial value for child Components? 

 ### How can you identify where state needs to live? 

 if i want to set an initial value and change inside component
